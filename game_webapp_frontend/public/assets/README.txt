Place Figma image assets in this folder for Create React App to serve them at /assets/*.

Expected files (already provided in the repository under assets/figmaimages/):
- figma_image_66_224.png
- figma_image_27_231.png
- figma_image_190_68.png
- figma_image_190_74.png
- figma_image_190_78.png

During CI or deployment, these images should be copied here. If running locally, copy from:
../../assets/figmaimages/* -> this folder.

Note: This README is included to satisfy path existence and document asset handling without embedding binaries in code edits.
